      <p><em>One of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's <strong>Uchiha clan</strong></em></p>
      <p>Sasuke is the second and youngest son of Mikoto and Fugaku Uchiha; they named him after Sasuke Sarutobi in the hopes that he would someday be just as strong of a shinobi.[10] Sasuke grew up in the shadow of his older brother, Itachi, a
          natural prodigy who many in the Uchiha clan and the village would constantly compare Sasuke and any of his accomplishments to. Sasuke himself adored Itachi, never passing up an opportunity to spend time with him. Although Itachi welcomed his
          company , letting Sasuke watch him train and taking him on adventures into the forests,[11] Itachi in return rarely helped Sasuke himself become a better shinobi; when asked, he would often instead poke Sasuke's forehead and promise to do so some other
          time. Sasuke found this annoying, but didn't allow it to blemish his high opinion of his brother.</p></td>
